Exercise 3.2: A deployment pipeline to a cloud service

In Exercise 1.16 [https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6#exercises-115-116] you deployed a containerized app to a cloud service.

Now it is time to improve your solution by setting up a deployment pipeline for it so that every push to GitHub results in a new deployment to the cloud service.

You will most likely find a ready-made GitHub Action that does most of the heavy lifting your you... Google is your friend!

Submit a link to the repository with the config. The repository README should have a link to the deployed application.
